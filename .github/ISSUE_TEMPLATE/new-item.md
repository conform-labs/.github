### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

<!-- 
Only use "Description" if additional context is required. 
If not, all details should be included under the appropriate Task item. 

- Add any subtasks or requirements under the Task they relate to (if needed).
- For most issues, you only need a simple list of tasks.

- Tasks should just be plain text instead of linking to another issue, unless it is an Epic.
- Epic issues may include "Sub Issues" by referencing other GitHub issues (e.g., #123)
- Epic issues should not be put in TODO.
- Assigned issues should not have sub-issues.

ðŸ’¡ Example of a task with subtasks/requirements:
- [ ] Implement login button
  - [ ] Sub task / requirements

ðŸ“Œ Clarification: 
- An "Issue" is the GitHub issue itself (the thing you are creating here). 
- "Tasks" are the checklist items within that issue.

This approach makes issue management simpler and more understandable.
